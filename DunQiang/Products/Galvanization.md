### **Wire Galvanization**  

**Purpose:**  
Galvanization applies a zinc coating to steel wires to protect them from rust and corrosion caused by environmental exposure. The type and thickness of the zinc coating determine the durability and cost of the wire, making it suitable for various applications.

### **Galvanization Types and Processes**  

#### **1. Cold-Drawn Wire (改拔丝)**  
**Process:**  
- Starts with untreated steel wire that is mechanically drawn through a die to enhance its strength and surface finish.  
- A very thin zinc layer (5–10 g/㎡) is applied during or after the drawing process, typically through electroplating.  

**Features:**  
- Provides basic rust protection.  
- Least expensive due to minimal zinc use and simple manufacturing.  

**Applications:**  
- Temporary fencing or indoor use where rust resistance is not critical.  

**Cost:**  
- Lowest among all options.  

---

#### **2. Electro-Galvanizing (电镀锌)**  
**Process:**  
- The wire is immersed in an electrolyte solution containing zinc salts.  
- An electric current causes zinc ions to deposit evenly onto the wire surface.  
- Zinc Coating: Approximately 15 g/㎡.  

**Features:**  
- Smooth, shiny finish with moderate rust protection.  
- A thin zinc layer balances corrosion resistance and affordability.  

**Applications:**  
- Light-duty fencing for indoor or low-corrosion environments.  

**Cost:**  
- Affordable, slightly higher than cold-drawn wire.  

---

#### **3. Standard Hot-Dip Galvanizing (普通热镀锌)**  
**Process:**  
- The wire is cleaned, pickled, and dipped into molten zinc at ~450°C.  
- A metallurgical reaction forms a protective zinc-iron alloy coating.  
- Zinc Coating: 30–60 g/㎡.  

**Features:**  
- Provides a thicker and more durable coating compared to electro-galvanizing.  
- Rust resistance suitable for outdoor conditions.  

**Applications:**  
- Commonly used for agricultural, garden, or utility fencing.  

**Cost:**  
- Moderate, with a good balance between price and performance.  

---

#### **4. High Hot-Dip Galvanizing (高热镀锌)**  
**Process:**  
- Similar to standard hot-dip galvanizing but involves prolonged immersion in molten zinc or additional cooling steps to achieve a thicker zinc coating.  
- Zinc Coating: 200 g/㎡ or more.  

**Features:**  
- Provides exceptional rust protection for harsh environments.  
- Extended lifespan compared to standard hot-dip.  

**Applications:**  
- Premium-grade fencing for industrial, security, or coastal areas.  

**Cost:**  
- Higher than standard hot-dip, reflecting superior durability.  

---

#### **5. Zinc-Aluminum Alloy Galvanizing (锌铝镀锌丝)**  
**Process:**  
- The wire is dipped in a specialized molten bath containing zinc and 5–10% aluminum.  
- The aluminum enhances adhesion, reduces wear, and provides additional corrosion resistance.  
- Zinc Coating: Equivalent to high hot-dip (200 g/㎡ or more).  

**Features:**  
- The longest-lasting galvanization option due to the combined benefits of zinc and aluminum.  
- Excellent performance in highly corrosive environments.  

**Applications:**  
- High-end fencing for industrial, marine, or coastal areas requiring long-term durability.  

**Cost:**  
- The highest among all options, reflecting its premium quality.

### **Relationship Between Galvanization Type, Price, and Durability**  

#### **Price:**  
- **Trend:** Increases with the level of zinc coating and the complexity of the process.  
- **Order:** Cold-Drawn → Electro-Galvanized → Standard Hot-Dip → High Hot-Dip → Zinc-Aluminum Alloy.  

#### **Durability:**  
- **Trend:** Higher zinc coating or the addition of aluminum extends corrosion resistance.  
- **Order:**  
  - **Cold-Drawn Wire:** Shortest lifespan.  
  - **Electro-Galvanized:** Moderate lifespan.  
  - **Standard Hot-Dip:** Good lifespan for outdoor use.  
  - **High Hot-Dip:** Long lifespan in harsh conditions.  
  - **Zinc-Aluminum Alloy:** Longest lifespan, even in extreme environments.
