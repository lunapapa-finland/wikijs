# Practical Ways to Narrow Down Potential Customers

  Visit [TED](https://ted.europa.eu/).  
  Search tenders using keywords like "fencing," "mesh," "perimeter security," or relevant CPV codes.
- **Why:**  
  Get direct access to active EU government projects needing fencing solutions.
- **Tip:**  
  Save searches and set alerts to get notifications for new tenders.

  Look for fencing or construction expos like **Perimeter Protection Expo** (Germany) or **BATIMAT** (France).  
  Register as an exhibitor or attendee.

  Meet buyers and contractors who source materials for large-scale projects.

  Use a translator or local partner to maximize engagement.

## 3. Search B2B Marketplaces
- **What to Do:**  
  List your products on platforms like **Europages**, **Alibaba**, or **Made-in-China** targeting European buyers.  
  Highlight your certifications (e.g., CE marking).
- **Why:**  
  Attract buyers already sourcing fencing products.
- **Tip:**  
  Use precise product descriptions and professional images.

- **Why:**  
  Spot smaller-scale projects not listed on international platforms.
- **Tip:**  
  Start with countries like Germany, France, or Scandinavia for higher infrastructure budgets.

- **Tip:**  
  Offer competitive pricing and reliable logistics to attract distributors.

  Use tools like **Owler** or **SimilarWeb** for deeper insights.
- **Why:**  
  Target similar buyers who already need fencing solutions.
- **Tip:**  
  Customize your pitch to highlight your competitive advantages.

---

## 8. Use Country-Specific Portals

  Search for tenders related to fencing.

  Access smaller local tenders not listed on TED.

  Use Google Translate to navigate portals in local languages.
