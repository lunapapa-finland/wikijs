# **Packaging Standards**  

Our packaging is meticulously designed to ensure the safe transport of all products, tailored to the specific needs of mesh, fences, barriers, and wires. Common packaging methods include:  

1. **Mesh Products (Chain Link, Hexagonal, Welded, and Gabion)**:  
   - **Rolls with Plastic Wrapping**: Mesh rolls are tightly wound and wrapped in waterproof plastic film to prevent moisture damage.  
   - **Palletized Bundles**: Rolls or sheets are stacked and secured with metal or plastic straps on wooden pallets for easy handling and loading.  
   - **Customizable Packaging**: Additional outer layers or cartons can be applied for enhanced protection.  

2. **Fences (Panels and Posts)**:  
   - **Flat Stacked Panels**: Fence panels are stacked flat, separated by cardboard or foam sheets to prevent scratching.  
   - **Shrink-Wrapped Pallets**: Panels and posts are bundled and shrink-wrapped on reinforced pallets to ensure stability during transport.  
   - **Protective Corner Guards**: Foam or rubber guards are used at corners to protect against impacts.  

3. **Barriers (Hesco Barriers, Temporary Barriers)**:  
   - **Individual Units or Nested Sets**: Hesco barriers are packed individually or nested for compact shipping.  
   - **Metal Frames or Crates**: For temporary barriers, components are placed in metal frames or custom crates to prevent deformation.  
   - **Weatherproof Wrapping**: Ensures the barriers are protected from rust or moisture during transit.  

4. **Wires (Barbed Wire, Galvanized Wire)**:  
   - **Coils with Plastic or Hessian Cloth Wrapping**: Wire is tightly coiled and wrapped to prevent tangling and surface damage.  
   - **Wooden or Plastic Reels**: For larger quantities, wires are wound on durable reels for ease of use and transport.  
   - **Reinforced Pallets**: Coils or reels are stacked on pallets and secured with straps for stability during shipment.  

5. **Additional Protective Measures**:  
   - **Waterproof Liners**: Used to prevent moisture damage for all products.  
   - **Custom Labels**: Each package includes clear labels for product identification, specifications, and handling instructions.  
   - **Compliance with Standards**: All packaging adheres to export and customer-specific standards, ensuring smooth customs clearance and transport.  

These tailored packaging methods guarantee that our mesh, fences, barriers, and wires arrive at their destination in optimal condition, ready for immediate use or further handling.
