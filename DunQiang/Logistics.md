# **Logistics Overview**
1. **Shipping Port**:  
   - All products are typically shipped from **[Tianjin Port](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Tianjin+Port/@39.3861594,116.5249465,8.42z?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTIwNC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D)**, one of China's largest and most efficient ports, ensuring streamlined export processes and reliable global connectivity.  
   - The port's proximity to our manufacturing facility allows for reduced lead times and better logistical coordination, ensuring that shipments are dispatched promptly.  

2. **Shipping Options**:  
   - We offer flexible shipping terms based on customer requirements:  
     - **FOB (Free on Board)**: The cost of transporting the goods to the port and loading them onto the vessel is included, giving customers control over shipping arrangements from the port onward.  
     - **CIF (Cost, Insurance, and Freight)**: We manage the shipping and insurance to the destination port, providing a convenient, all-inclusive solution for customers seeking less complexity.  
   - Additional support for customs clearance, packaging requirements, and special shipping instructions can be accommodated.

3. **Shipping Timeframes**:  
   - Delivery times depend on the destination port and selected shipping method:  
     - **FOB**: Usually 2-3 days after production for vessel loading.  
     - **CIF**: Includes transit time, typically ranging from 20 to 45 days, depending on the destination.
