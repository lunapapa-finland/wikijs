## Process of Woven Wire Fences

### **1. Material Selection**  
- High-tensile steel wire is chosen for strength, durability, and compatibility with coatings (galvanization and PVC).  

---

### **2. Wire Drawing**  
- Steel rods are drawn through dies to achieve the desired wire diameter.  
- This step increases tensile strength and ensures uniformity.  

---

### **3. Wire Galvanization (Optional)**  
- **Purpose:** Adds a zinc coating to protect the wire from rust and corrosion.  
- **Methods:**
  - **Hot-Dip Galvanizing:** Thick zinc layer for maximum protection.  
  - **Electro-Galvanizing:** Thinner zinc layer, more cost-effective.  

---

### **4. PVC Coating (Optional)**  
- **When Applied:** After galvanization for maximum protection.  
- **Process:**  
  - Galvanized wire is passed through a PVC extrusion machine or dipped in molten PVC.  
  - The PVC layer is fused tightly to the wire to provide additional corrosion resistance, UV protection, and aesthetic enhancement.  
- **Benefits:**  
  - Protects the galvanized coating from physical damage and environmental wear.  
  - Enhances the lifespan of the fence.  

---

### **5. Wire Straightening and Cutting**  
- PVC-coated or galvanized wires are straightened and cut to required lengths for horizontal and vertical components.  

---

### **6. Knot Formation and Weaving**  
- **Process:**  
  - Wires are woven into the chosen fence pattern (e.g., hinge joint, fixed knot).  
  - Specialized machines secure intersections with the appropriate knot type.  
- **Key Consideration:**  
  - PVC-coated wires are handled carefully to avoid damaging the coating during this step.  

---

### **7. Tensioning and Quality Control**  
- The woven fence is tensioned to ensure knot strength and flexibility.  
- Quality checks are performed to verify spacing, knot integrity, and coating quality.  

---

### **8. Cutting and Rolling**  
- Finished fence panels are cut to standard or customized sizes.  
- Rolled into compact bundles for ease of handling and shipping.  

---

### **9. Packaging and Labeling**  
- Rolls are secured with protective coverings (e.g., plastic wrap, metal bands).  
- Products are labeled with specifications such as size, knot type, and coatings (galvanized, PVC, or both).  

---

### **Key Takeaway:**
The PVC coating process is positioned **immediately after galvanization** (if both are applied) to ensure that the wire is fully protected before weaving. This is essential because weaving machines could damage the PVC layer if applied after the wire is shaped into a fence.
