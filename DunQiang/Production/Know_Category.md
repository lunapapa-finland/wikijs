### **Category: Knot Types in Woven Wire Fences**

1. **Hinge Joint Knot**  
   - The most common knot in woven wire fencing.  
   - Consists of a continuous piece of wire that wraps around vertical and horizontal wires.  
   - Acts as a flexible joint, allowing the fence to absorb impacts (e.g., from livestock) without breaking.  
   - **Relationship with Hinge**:  
     - The "hinge" in the hinge joint knot provides elasticity and durability, making the fence more resilient to pressure or deformation.  
     - It enables the fence to flex slightly without compromising structural integrity.

2. **Fixed Knot**  
   - Created by tying vertical wires to horizontal wires using a separate knotting wire.  
   - Offers superior strength and rigidity compared to hinge joint knots.  
   - **Relationship with Hinge**:  
     - Unlike hinge joint knots, fixed knots lack the flexible "hinge" mechanism.  
     - This rigidity makes them ideal for high-tensile applications or security fencing.

3. **Square Knot**  
   - Features a rigid structure with intersecting wires forming square patterns.  
   - Less common in woven wire fencing due to limited flexibility.  
   - **Relationship with Hinge**:  
     - Provides no hinge-like properties.  
     - Used in applications where strength is prioritized over flexibility.
