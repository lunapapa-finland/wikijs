# Homepage for Future Trading

## Overview
Trading futures involves speculating on the price movement of commodities, currencies, indices, or other financial instruments at a predetermined future date. One effective approach to trading futures is utilizing price action, which focuses on analyzing historical prices to make informed trading decisions without relying heavily on technical indicators or complex algorithms.

I am committed to continuously applying the PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) cycle to refine this wiki until I achieve consistent profitability.
