# Support and Resistance
- S/R could be MAs,Trend Lines, Trend Channel Lines, Prior Highs and Lows(Swing High/Low), Measured Move Projections, **Round Numbers**, etc. Which is important is highly depending on the context!
- Forex S/R never exact since every broker has own data, while Emini is identical from the data perspective.
- Prior H/L often tested after BO
