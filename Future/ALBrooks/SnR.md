# Support and Resistance
- S/R could be Top/Bottom of the TR, MAs,Trend Lines, Trend Channel Lines, Prior Highs and Lows(Swing High/Low), Measured Move Projections, 50% PB, **Round Numbers**, etc. Which is important is highly depending on the context!
- Most Round Numbers are option strike prices, Emini is about 10X SPY, so EMINI is close to the SPY 211. Every 10 points in Emini is around number S/R. Institutions sell options, so they want them to lose value. They trade options, and underlying, to make options expire worthless. This means at strike prices, so strike prices are magnets![S/R](##In regards to the options call/put wall)
- Forex S/R never exact since every broker has own data, while Emini is identical from the data perspective.
- Prior H/L often tested after BO - BO PB


## In regards to the options call/put wall
### Here's a more accurate explanation:

**Options Sellers' Goals**: When institutions (or any options sellers) sell options, they collect a premium upfront. Their primary goal is for the option to expire worthless, meaning that the option holder has no incentive to exercise the option. This allows the seller to keep the premium without any further obligation.

1. **Call Option**:
   - If an institution sells a call option, they want the price of the underlying asset to stay **at or below the strike price** as expiration approaches.
   - If the underlying asset's price is at or below the strike price, the call option will expire worthless because the buyer has no reason to buy the asset at the strike price when they could buy it for the same price or less in the open market.

2. **Put Option**:
   - If an institution sells a put option, they want the price of the underlying asset to stay **at or above the strike price** as expiration approaches.
   - If the underlying asset's price is at or above the strike price, the put option will expire worthless because the buyer has no reason to sell the asset at the strike price when they could sell it for the same price or more in the open market.

### Clarification:

- The goal of the option seller is to see the price of the underlying asset close to, but not surpassing (in the case of calls) or not falling below (in the case of puts) the strike price as expiration nears.
- **At-the-money (ATM) options**: If the underlying asset's price is exactly at the strike price as expiration approaches, the option has intrinsic value, but minimal. This is often desirable for sellers because time decay (theta) erodes the option's value as it nears expiration.
- **Out-of-the-money (OTM) options**: If the underlying asset's price is below the strike price for a call or above the strike price for a put, the option will expire worthless, which is the ideal outcome for the seller.

So, while keeping the price "near" the strike price can be beneficial (especially for strategies involving adjustments or hedging), the ultimate goal for option sellers is to have the price either not breach the strike price (in the case of calls) or not drop below it (in the case of puts) at expiration, rendering the option worthless.
