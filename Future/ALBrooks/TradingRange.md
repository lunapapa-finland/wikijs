# Trading Range

- BLSHS
- Pull back more than 20 bars, prefer to be TR and Neutral, prior trend too far in past, lost almost all influence
- Big UP, Big DOWN, BIG Confusion
- Signal Bars and setups are weak
- Trends are weak 
- Things that look bad are not as bad(No Trend); Things that look good are not as good(No Trend)
- 2nd leg trap and vacuums, offen looks strong just before reversal, 2nd leg is usually stronger than the 1st leg
- Strong BO while it fails, lack of follow-through
- **Pull-back Usually returns back and fall below/above the BO bar(Two Bars reversal), BUT you still need to check the how strong the BO and PB pairs are. Two Bars reversal could potentially lead to TR, but it is not guaranteed to be that!! IF, PBs go back FAR beyond the BO start, there is a high probability that it becomes back to a TR**
- There is NO GAP(GAP will be closed)
- In the TR, there will be some setups like swing up/down and deep PB reversely
- TR in small time frame could be a PB or leg in the higher time frame, that is why higher time frame is always used to determine the S/R, while the lower time frame is use to determine the time to open/close position
- only trade the direction of the TREND with a short length of time forming the TR.
- minimum for TR: 3 legs(e.g. leg up/down/up) and 20 bars
	- Leg down, so pullback in Bull Trend
  - Leg up, BO of Bull Flag, Trend Resumption
  - As soon as 3rd leg down falls below strong bull BO, and PB has at least 20 bars, Now in TR
- equal chance of trend resumption up and trend reversal down, there is always but and sell setups in TR
- TR never have a very clear S/R, they are the range. That's why 1/4 buy and sell is always reasonable than extreme values
- use WIDE Stops and Scale IN(Only if you believe in TR)
	- Can use limit Order for scale in
  - if the price goes beyond, the only time to scale in is the price beyond the scalp length, e.g. ES 5 point, NQ 20 points
  - The next scalp in should be stop order instead of limit order to add winning probability
  - In order to AT LEAST get 1 entry break even and second entry scalp profit
- Bull BO above bull Channel, 75% fail within 5 Bars(which mean the bad follow through bar, high chance to form Micro DT. Head-Shoulder-Head, 2nd entry has more probability to win).(This is just the probability, sometimes, Strong trend -> weak trend -> BO could lead to another strong trend, but still, you'd better look at the S/R at higher timegframe)
- If the trend is a tight channel, expect more trend instead of trend reversal, lower probability to return back to the start of the channel and form a TR.
- **Dead Money**: When price falls sharply on daily, weekly, or monthly chart, often goes sideways, for 20 or more bars, in a tight trading range, which is NOT suitable for trading!! Imagine a big sell off for consecutive bars, the probability of direct reversal is LOW, on the other hand, it is high probability to form a TR or even a TTR, which is not suitable for trading!
- **Strong BO, GOOD follow through, high probability of moer rally
- There is a little bit high probability that at the end of the trend(Strong Trend), if TTR shows up and form some pattern like DT, it could lead to a DT LH MTR, NOTE that entry shold always depends on the actual setups like, fail BO of DT!! **AND if it happens, expecting 2nd Leg!(i.e. trapped-in loser will stop loss if price goes back and trapped-out trader will limit buy since they did not enter the position!)**
- Vaccum Effect at Top and Bottom of the TR: Once the market gets close to the top and bottom of the TR, it is within gravitational field of edge of range. Closer it gets, stronger magnetic pull and FASTER market moves!!
