# Trading Range

- BLSHS
- Pull back more than 20 bars, prefer to be TR and Neutral, prior trend too far in past, lost almost all influence
- Big UP, Big DOWN, BIG Confusion
- Signal Bars and setups are weak
- Trends are weak 
- Things that look bad are not as bad(No Trend); Things that look good are not as good(No Trend)
- 2nd leg trap and vacuums, offen looks strong just before reversal
- Strong BO while it fails, lack of follow-through
- **Pull-back Usually returns back and fall below/above the BO bar(Two Bars reversal), BUT you still need to check the how strong the BO and PB pairs are. Two Bars reversal could potentially lead to TR, but it is not guaranteed to be that!! IF, PBs go back FAR beyond the BO start, there is a high probability that it becomes back to a TR**
- There is NO GAP(GAP will be closed)
- In the TR, there will be some setups like swing up/down and deep PB reversely
- TR in small time frame could be a PB or leg in the higher time frame, that is why higher time frame is always used to determine the S/R, while the lower time frame is use to determine the time to open/close position
- only trade the direction of the TREND with a short length of time forming the TR.
- minimum for TR: 3 legs(e.g. leg up/down/up) and 20 bars
	- Leg down, so pullback in Bull Trend
  - Leg up, BO of Bull Flag, Trend Resumption
  - As soon as 3rd leg down falls below strong bull BO, and PB has at least 20 bars, Now in TR
- equal chance of trend resumption up and trend reversal down, there is always but and sell setups in TR
- TR never have a very clear S/R, they are the range. That's why 1/4 buy and sell is always reasonable than extreme values
- use WIDE Stops and Scale IN
