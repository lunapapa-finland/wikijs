# Measured Move	
- Market has BO that moves same distance as something prior: 
	- could be Height of prior leg
  - could be Height of TR
  - could be height of prior BO
- Leg1 = leg2 is minimum goal when PB is deep(around50%), after that, **You should observe the price action at that level and probably the trend will continue(strong enough) to try to reach the REAL S/R**
	 - when trend is less strong, or within TR, or has deep PB, traders expect 2nd leg up to be end of rally. also also follows A DEEPER PB(or at least of the TR above the 1st leg)
 - Start of the MM is always NOT clear enough! So the target of TP is subjective and you have to monitor the strengh of the price action
- If clear TR after leg 1(which means the PB after Leg 1 is almost same back to the start of the TR). leg 1 then ends at the start of the TR, and leg 2 starts at end of the TR(which means the BO will of the TR will be treated as the continuation of the leg2, including the part of the TR itself)
