- Market has BO that moves same distance as something prior: 
	- could be Height of prior leg
  - could be Height of TR
  - could be height of prior BO
- Leg1 = leg2 is minimum goal when PB is deep(around50%)
	 - when trend is less strong, or within TR, or has deep PB, traders expect 2nd leg up to be end of rally. also also follows A DEEPER PB
